# Flux Capacitor Mini with USB-C
### WHAT IS IT?
A miniature version of Flux Capacitor from the movie trilogy Back to the Future. Measuring at only 48mm x 38mm (1.89in x 1.5in), it can be easily pocketable . It is constructed with high quality 3D printed frame, sandwiched between stacked Gold Plated PCBs. Featuring 25 LEDs, diffused through bare FR4 material, that animate to create the “fluxxing” effect. It’s 100% decorative, it doesn’t actually let you travel through time. But let's not lose hope. Maybe in the future.

This tiny Flux Capacitor is controlled by a Microchip ATtiny1616 microcontroller. Thankfully this board has a much lower power requirement than the what it indicates on the back, and skips along, sipping power from the single CR2032/LIR2032 coin cell battery (instead of plutonium or a lightning strike). By using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) pins for 8 channels of 3 paralleled LEDs, different animation patterns are generated for the fluxxxing effect. In settings mode, users are able change between 8 different types of animation, 8 levels of speed and LED brightness.

### BATTERY IS NOT INCLUDED DUE TO SHIPPING RESTRICTIONS !

### !!! WARNING !!!
- Do not charge or connect to a power source while a non-rechargeable battery is inserted!
- You don't have to insert a battery if you just want to power it over USB-C.
- You can charge it with USB-C while a rechargeable battery is inserted.
- Only CR2032 non-rechargeable and LIR2032 rechargeable batteries are supported.

### POWER REQUIREMENT
Device requires 1.21 Gigawatts ("Jigowatts") of power to operate. That amount of power is no match for an ordinary power supply. Luckily we've developed a miniature nuclear reactor named LIR2032 that needs to be placed inside the device. LIR2032 also encapsulates a small pellet of Plutonium to be used as fuel to generate enough power. This miniature reactor is able to supply all the power required for the Flux Capacitor. Ok, joke aside this entire paragraph is totally not true.

### HOW LONG WILL THE BATTERY LAST?
CR2032 (Non-Rechargeable) with average of 210mAh battery capacity.

- 100% LED Brightness :  57 Hours
- 25%  LED Brightness :  110 Hours

LIR2032 (Rechargeable) with average of 40mAh battery capacity.

- 100% LED Brightness :  11 Hours
- 25%  LED Brightness :  21 Hours

### CHARGING

After you deplete the battery and want to charge the device, make sure you have a rechargeable battery inserted and just plug it in to any USB-C cable which is connected to a power supply or a computer's USB port. While charging the battery Radioactive Hazard symbol on the back will glow Red to indicate charging status. After charging is complete the symbol will glow Green.

### HOW TO SETUP AND OPERATE

To begin with, turn on the device by pressing power button. In order to enter settings mode just hold the set button for 1 second. If all of the LEDs flashes twice, you are successfully entered settings mode. 

After the LEDs flash you will see that only single LED remains on. That single LED shows which animation is selected. To change that, just short press the set button and the LED should start shifting from inner to outer LED with each press. After selecting the preferred animation, hold the set button for 1 second to save. LEDs should flash twice to confirm.

Next setting is animation speed. To change the animation speed, just short press the set button to increase the speed. LEDs will turn on from inner to outer to indicate animation speed. At maximum speed all LEDs should be on. Hold the set button for 1 second to save animation speed. LEDs should flash twice to confirm.

Last setting is LED brightness. Same as before to change the brightness just short press the set buttonto increase the brightness. LEDs will turn on from inner to outer to indicate brightness level. At maximum brightness all LEDs should be on. Hold the set button for 1 second to save brightness setting. LEDs should flash twice to confirm and device should exit the setting mode. LEDs should start animating.

**If you short press the button with gear icon during normal operation, device initiates engage mode.
LEDs start to animate faster with much brighter center beam as shown in the video below.**

### WHAT MAKES THIS DEVICE SPECIAL?
First of all, the gold plating on the PCB makes it look luxurious. You can wear it around your neck with an ID card strap, hang it on your keychain or... you can place it on your car's dashboard and try and see if the time travel is possible while you're driving at 88mph. Time travel at your own RISK! If you stuck in unknown territories of time, try turning on the SOS mode of the Flux Capacitor (Animation 5 or 101 LED combination). Help may or may not arrive. NO GUARANTEES.
